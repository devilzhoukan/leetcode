## interesting problem

* brute force solution 
recursion:
double for loop, O(n^2)
no need to write.

* recursion optimization  
since you get temp Max area, the index gap must be more than temp / height[i]
but still O(n^2)

* 2 ptr approach
2 ptr from begining and end, must choose the longer one to be left
it's O(n) now

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int result = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = height.size() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            result = std::max(result, std::min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l));
            if (height[l] < height[r]) {
                l++;
            }
            else {
                r--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
