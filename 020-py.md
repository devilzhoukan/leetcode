## 20. Valid Parentheses
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

My first idea is somehow brute force
```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        pairMap = {")": "(",
                  "}": "{",
                  "]": "[",
                  }
        if not s:
            return True
        if s[0] in pairMap:
            return False
        
        tempList = []
        for c in s:
            if c in pairMap:
                pair = pairMap[c]
                if (not tempList) or (tempList[-1] != pair):
                    return False
                else:
                    tempList.pop()
            else:
                tempList.append(c)
        return not tempList
```
it's not fast and use much memory.

(Though it's O(N) anyway)
while, since you use pop, just 
```
tempList.pop() != pair
```
A little faster, (but not easy to understand)
I'll always choose __readability__.
