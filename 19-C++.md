# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

### Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

* brute: 
Go through, and get the number of the Nodes
Now you get the number from the beginning, remoive it.

* One pass way:
maintain a (n-1) length linked list, 1 speprate node. When meet the ending, 
remove the seprate one and add front part to the (n-1) part.

```C++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode* resultHead = head;
        ListNode* frontPart = head;
        ListNode* NthFromEnd = head;
        ListNode* backPart = head;
        ListNode* endingProbe = head;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            endingProbe = endingProbe -> next;
        }
        backPart = backPart -> next;
        
        // if length is n
        if (endingProbe -> next == nullptr) {
            return backPart;
        }
        
        // move ptrs 1 step
        NthFromEnd = NthFromEnd -> next;
        backPart = backPart -> next;
        endingProbe = endingProbe -> next;
        
        while (endingProbe -> next != nullptr) {
            frontPart = frontPart -> next;
            NthFromEnd = NthFromEnd -> next;
            backPart = backPart -> next;
            endingProbe = endingProbe -> next;
        }
        
        frontPart -> next = backPart;
        NthFromEnd -> next = nullptr;
        delete NthFromEnd;
        return resultHead;
    }
};
```

#### discussion
In fact, the "backPart" ptr is not needed, neither the "Nth" ptr.
Since it can always keep the distance between "frontPart" and "ending",
the Nth is always frontPart -> next, and backPart is always frontPart -> next -> next;
Remember delete the Node since there is no GC in C++
